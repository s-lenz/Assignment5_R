# Overview
The purpose of this repository is to document my walk through of making machine learning models in R and store the graphs.

# Assignment 5 â€“ R Machine Learning Walkthrough

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that walks through the creation and validation of machine learning models in R, based on exercises from the R tutorial applied to the iris dataset. The goal is to practice applying common statistical and plotting techniques that will be useful in future data analysis labs.
